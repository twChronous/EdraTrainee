The dataset includes 97 images.
Circulo-com-sinal-positivo are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 10 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random shear of between -30° to +30° horizontally and -7° to +7° vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 6.5 pixels
